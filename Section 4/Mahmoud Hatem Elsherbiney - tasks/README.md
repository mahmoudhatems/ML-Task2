## 📚 Tasks Description

### Task 1: Regression Models

**File:** `Task_1.ipynb`

#### 1.1 Linear Regression - Salary Prediction
Predicts salary based on years of experience using linear regression.

- **Dataset:** Years of experience (1-6 years) with corresponding salaries
- **Objective:** Predict salary for 7 years of experience
- **Features:** 
  - Independent variable: Years of experience
  - Dependent variable: Salary (in thousands)
- **Output:** Predicted salary and visualization of the regression line

#### 1.2 Logistic Regression - Pass/Fail Prediction
Classifies students as Pass or Fail based on study hours.

- **Dataset:** Study hours (1-7) with binary outcomes (Pass/Fail)
- **Objective:** Predict pass/fail for 4.5 study hours
- **Features:**
  - Independent variable: Study hours
  - Dependent variable: Pass (1) or Fail (0)
- **Output:** Prediction result, probability score, and decision boundary visualization

### Task 2: Classification Models

**File:** `Task_2.ipynb`

#### 2.1 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) - Student Performance
Predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on study and sleep hours.

- **Dataset:** 10 students with study hours, sleep hours, and outcomes
- **Model:** KNN with k=3 neighbors
- **Features:**
  - Study hours per day
  - Sleep hours per night
  - Target: Pass (1) or Fail (0)
- **Test Case:** Student with 6 hours study and 7 hours sleep
- **Output:** Pass/Fail prediction

#### 2.2 Naive Bayes - Tennis Play Decision
Determines whether to play tennis based on weather conditions.

- **Dataset:** 14 instances with weather attributes
- **Model:** Categorical Naive Bayes
- **Features:**
  - Outlook: Sunny, Overcast, Rainy
  - Temperature: Hot, Mild, Cool
  - Humidity: High, Normal
  - Windy: True, False
- **Test Case:** Sunny, Mild temperature, Normal humidity, Not windy
- **Output:** Yes/No decision for playing tennis

### Task 3: Real-World Application

**File:** `Task_3.ipynb`

#### Calories Burned Prediction Pipeline
Predicts calories burned during exercise using a complete ML pipeline with preprocessing.

- **Dataset:** CSV file containing exercise and personal metrics
- **Model:** Linear Regression with preprocessing pipeline
- **Pipeline Components:**
  1. **StandardScaler:** Normalizes numerical features
  2. **OneHotEncoder:** Encodes categorical features
  3. **LinearRegression:** Makes predictions
- **Features:**
  - Age, Weight, Height
  - Exercise duration
  - Heart rate
  - Activity type (categorical)
- **Workflow:**
  1. Load and explore data
  2. Separate numerical and categorical features
  3. Build preprocessing pipeline
  4. Train/test split (80/20)
  5. Model training and evaluation
  6. Predict calories for new input
- **Output:** RMSE score and predicted calories burned
